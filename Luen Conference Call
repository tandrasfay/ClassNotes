### Notes from Luen's Conference Call

Code isn't his final version due to laptop failure.

#### Error Diagram
Think of both tau and error as a function of a conditional intensity.
We can think of lambda (conditional intensity) as a threshold at which we turn on the alarm.
How do we evaluate tau = proportion of time the alarm is on?
Proportion of events that have a conditional intensity less than lambda is equal to the proportion of events you miss.
Can also do in terms of window length--increases from left to right. Find what proportion of time is covered by 
that window length. 
Hindsight, Luen believes it might be easier to work in terms of conditional intensity lambda, and then translate back
to window length. 

For a particular window length, the interarrival times are the only thing in our prediction; lambda is found with the 
cdf. For instance, set lambda = 1/w. Totally wrong to predict the absolute number of earthquakes, but it will get you 
somewhat consistent with ETAS.
Window lengths adjusted for magnitude. Same principle as automatic alarms. 

Looking at the code uploaded. 

Whether to use moment magnitude or body-wave magnitude? Usually swept under the rug. Generally people are sloppy about
this. Only matters at high magnitudes because at low magnitudes both magnitude types are about the same. 

Code trying to do 4 things:
Find temporal distributions 
List suffixes are finding conditional intensities or window lengths at the time that the event occurs.
Want to do for every event in the test set.
Proportion of events with lambda < lambda-threshold is the nu (error) value at that point. 

Training Set:
Grid of times from beginning of training period to end of training period in periods of 1 day.

How many values of lambda to generate the diagram?
Thousands of values of lambda. Enough to draw diagram.

How to vary the tuning parameter?
Found parameter that worked best on the training set. Just trial and error (Could do something more sophisticated--like
optimization). 1 decimal place is find. Apply to the grid. See how well you do. Find area under error diagram (Not always
the best method).

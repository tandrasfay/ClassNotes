IPython
Started in 2001 during Perez's Physics PhD
Better shell 
Allow plotting, parallel computing
repl: read evaluate print loop - R console, iPython, terminal
2010 fancier shell and a protocol- repl abstracted 
Now running in web browser-like Google Docs with computing ability
IPython can run as a slide show while running everything. All inclusive from analysis to presentation
